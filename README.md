Control Panel Nav is a Craft CMS plugin to help manage your Control Panel navigation. Take control over your Craft CMS control panel navigation with CP Nav. Rename, reorder, hide and show menu items in the control panel. You can even add your own custom menu items for external links, or commonly used URLs within Craft. Divider menu items can also be added to logically group menu items into sections.

## Features
- Modify the main sidebar navigation in the Craft control panel.
- Rename, reorder, remove any existing navigation items - including plugins and modules.
- Full support for nesting items up to 2 levels deep.
- Change the behaviour of subnav items:
    - Only open subnav items when the parent page is active (Craft default behaviour).
    - Always have subnav items open and visible.
    - Add a toggle next to each parent menu item to show/hide the subnav items. Will also remember the state!
- Add new custom URLs. Great for documentation, external links or nested pages.

- Manage icons of menu items. Choose from existing Craft icons, or upload your own assets.
- Support for layouts to manage multiple navigations depending on user groups.
